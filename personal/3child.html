            <h2>Choice Between Roles: Factors Influencing Chinese Married Females’ Work Participation 
                and A Prediction After Three-Child Policy</h2>
            <p class="abstract">
                This study analyzes the market wage, reservation wage, and unearned income on the probability 
                of work participation of married women by using the longitudinal data of the China Health and 
                Nutrition Survey from 1989 to 2015 by probit models. It is found Imputed income negatively 
                affects the probability of work participation of married women; the reservation wage positively 
                impacts the probability of work participation; though insignificant, unearned income positively 
                affects the probability of work participation of married women. Females who were working in 
                2015 were not willing to have an additional child, leading to the prediction that Three-Child 
                Policy would not drastically increase the birthrate if policies and laws are not fully constructed to 
                protect females’ rights. It is also predictable that unmarried women will still struggle to find jobs 
                because of the gender gap that still exists in workplaces and job markets.
